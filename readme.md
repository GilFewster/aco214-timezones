## Installing locally

1. Clone the repository (or fork it to your own Github account amd clone from there if you prefer)
2. Open the project in VS Code
3. Poke around in the code - the main stuff is in src/js/index.js

## Running the website locally

Parcel is configured to run a local server if you want to experiment with the code and run the site on your dev machine to test things out.

1. After you clone the repo, you'll need to open the terminal window from VS Code and run `npm i` to install the node dependencies
2. Start Parcel's local server by typing `npm run watch` from the terminal
3. Stop the server by clicking in the terminal and hitting the `ctrl-c` shortcut
